# Recruitment Analytics

### 

The goal of this data analysis project is to optimize the recruitment process by identifying bottlenecks and improving efficiency at various stages of the hiring pipeline. By leveraging data on candidate pipelines, interview feedback, job postings, and offer statuses, the project aims to enhance time-to-hire metrics and overall hiring success rates.

## The analysis will focus on the following areas:

- Pipeline Analysis: Examine where candidates drop off in the process to identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
- Time-to-Hire Metrics: Measure the average time candidates spend at each stage of the hiring process to pinpoint delays.
- Job Postings Performance: Evaluate which job postings attract the most candidates and identify postings that require optimization to improve visibility and appeal.
- Offer Outcomes: Analyze factors that influence offer acceptance or rejection to refine strategies for closing offers effectively.
